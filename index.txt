Aloha.

I'm Breck and my goals with Flash are to help entrepreneurs:

- become the best craftspeople they can be
- build the greatest products and teams they can create
- advance and preserve humanity, science and the public domain
- while preserving as much of their time as possible for walks in the woods

Those are my goals.

I will do many things along those lines.

I'm just getting started.

*Let's build together.*

Start by emailing breck7@gmail.com a link to what you are building.
